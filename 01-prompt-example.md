# Prompt Example 01 — Outreach Subject Lines

**Goal:** Generate 5 compelling outreach email subject lines targeting K-12 educators.

**Initial prompt:** "Write subject lines for an email."

**Issue observed:** Output was too generic.

**Improved prompt:** "Write 5 short, compelling email subject lines (≤ 8 words each) for K-12 educators announcing a 60-minute workshop on improving student engagement. Use an encouraging and professional tone."

**Example output:**
1. "Boost Classroom Engagement — Free 60-Min Workshop"
2. "Practical Strategies to Engage Your Students"
3. "Join Our Hands-On Student Engagement Workshop"
4. "Simple Techniques to Lift Classroom Participation"
5. "Free Workshop: Reignite Student Interest Today"

**Reflection:** Adding audience + goal + format improved output quality.
