# AI Testing Portfolio – Janice Garcia Mendoza

This repository supports my transition into tech and AI.

It will include:
- Prompt testing (trying prompts and improving the output)
- Reviewing AI responses for quality and accuracy
- Identifying errors and describing what needs improvement

I am adding examples as I complete them while applying.
